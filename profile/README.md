# 🎭 GHOST ARMY INTELLIGENCE

> *"The mission is deception. The weapon is information. The result is victory through strategy, not strength."*

**Honoring the WWII Ghost Army** — a top-secret U.S. unit that used inflatable tanks, sound effects, and phantom radio signals to deceive enemy forces. They saved thousands of lives through creativity, not firepower.

We carry that legacy forward in the digital domain: **Wardriving. Intelligence. Open-Source Signalcraft.**

## 🎖️ THE GHOST ARMY LEGACY

**1944-1945**: The 23rd Headquarters Special Troops conducted 20+ battlefield deceptions across Europe. Using inflatable tanks, fake radio traffic, and sonic deception, they impersonated entire divisions — confusing German forces and saving countless lives.

**Today**: We honor their ingenuity by building tools that give defenders the advantage through intelligence, not brute force.

**Their motto**: *"The best weapon is the one your enemy never sees."*

**Our mission**: Build tools that empower researchers, pentesters, and security professionals to gather intelligence, analyze data, and maintain operational security — all while keeping data sovereignty intact.
